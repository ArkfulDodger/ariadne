This project was developed by Noah Reece and Calypso Leonard over 5 days as their phase 2 project at the Flatiron School's Software Engineering program.

# Ariadne

Ariadne is a text-based adventure game based on the classic greek myth of Ariadne (better known as Theseus and the Minotaur). In our version, you play Ariadne as she ventures into the labyrinth after Theseus when he fails to return successfully.

In gameplay, you are faced with a series of forks in your path where you must decide how to proceed as you attempt to find Theseus and escape the way you came. Along the way, you may find items to help you on your journey, or you may encounter the deadly Minotaur.

Every failed attempt is recorded in the Memories page so you can reflect on your past failures and see what you can try differently on the next attempt!

With each new game, a new labyrinth map will be generated, so you will never be faced with the same map twice!
